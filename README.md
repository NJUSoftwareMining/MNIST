Deep Learning with MNIST Dataset
================================
This is an attempt at gaining high-level accurate predictions of numerical results using the MNIST dataset. It attempts to run the model through the following process:
1. Through a simple linear model
2. Through a fully connected, single layer neural network
3. Through a convolutional neural network (CNN)
4. Through a CNN with Batch Normalization

Dropout and Data Augmentation techniques are used to control for overfitting. Basic ensembling is used to achieve the best possible final results.

Installation
------------
